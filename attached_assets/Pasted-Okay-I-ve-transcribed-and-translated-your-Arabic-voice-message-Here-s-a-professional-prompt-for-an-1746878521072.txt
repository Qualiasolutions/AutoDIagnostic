Okay, I've transcribed and translated your Arabic voice message. Here's a professional prompt for an AI agent based on your request:

Prompt for AI Agent: Design a Software Application for Vehicle Diagnostics and Guided Maintenance

Objective:
Develop a software application (likely mobile-based) designed for vehicle diagnostics and maintenance assistance. The core purpose is to allow a user to connect their phone to a car's onboard computer system to identify issues, receive solutions, and potentially perform or be guided through basic maintenance tasks, especially concerning electrical problems within the car's computer.

Key Requirements & Functionalities:

Vehicle Interface:

The application must interface with the vehicle's onboard computer (ECU).

The proposed connection method involves a smartphone connected via a USB cable to the vehicle's 12V power outlet.

(AI Design Consideration): This likely implies the 12V outlet powers a USB-compatible OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) adapter, which then communicates data to the phone either via that USB connection or wirelessly after being powered. The application should be designed to work with common OBD-II adapters that might use USB for phone connectivity, or it needs to specify the exact nature of this 12V/USB data interface if it's a non-standard approach.

Diagnostic Capabilities:

Retrieve and interpret diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) from the vehicle's ECU.

Analyze data from the car's computer to identify existing problems and malfunctions.

Solution & Maintenance Guidance:

Provide users with clear explanations of diagnosed problems.

Offer potential solutions and step-by-step troubleshooting guidance.

Enable users to perform basic maintenance actions directly through the application where feasible (e.g., clearing fault codes related to the car's computer, especially for electrical issues, or initiating ECU-supported self-tests).

User Experience:

The application should be user-friendly, allowing individuals to effectively diagnose and address vehicle issues.

Specific Scenario to Address:
If an electrical problem is detected within the car's computer system (ECU), the application should not only diagnose it but also provide the capability or clear instructions for the user to perform necessary maintenance actions or resets via the software interface, leveraging its connection to the vehicle.
